# Getting and Cleaning Data #

Course Project
--------------

### Instructions ###

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect,
work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that
can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a
series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be
required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link
to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis,
and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any
transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called
CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your
scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they
are connected.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is
wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like
Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced
algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course
website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the
Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the
site where the data was obtained:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Here are the data for the project:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

 You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers
within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six
activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING,
STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the
waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured
3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant
rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the
data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into
two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the
training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by
applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows
of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor
acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion
components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into
body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to
have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz
cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was
obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency
domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration)
- and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
- Its activity label.
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on
  the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their
descriptions are equivalent.

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who
  performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1
  to 30.

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration
  signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity
  units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same
  description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and
  'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis.

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration
  signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total
  acceleration.

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity
  vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units
  are radians/second.

Notes:
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.

==================================================================

In order to have a tidy and useful data frame the following steps was taken:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Features ###

The text file features.txt is the list of all features and in this
case almost all column names of the UCI_HAR_Data data set.

### Training and test labels ###

The files train/y_train.txt and test/y_test.txt are the activity
labels for each row, separated initial train and test data frames was
used.

X_train.txt and X_test.txt are the main data sets, binding train and
test respectively with labels and using proper names from features
file was made in order to have the initial data frames.

### Inertial Signals ###

For each set, a set of sensor signals exists, each one was used to
calculate the mean and standard deviation for nine extra features for
each set (train and test).

Resulting in 18 new features that can be bind to the train or test
main data set that corresponds. After, rbind() method was used to
complete the unique tidy data set.

### Summary of UCI_HAR_Data ###

The tidy UCI_HAR_Data data set dimensions:

```R
dim(UCI_HAR_Data)
[1] 10299   582
```
All features are 'numeric' and NA doesn't exist.

### Dumping to a R format file ###

In order to accomplish the milestones 1 to 4 of assignment, the last
step was dump the complete UCI_HAR_Data data frame to a file named
UCI_HAR_Data.R


# Milestone 5: UCI_HAR_Averages #


UCI_HAR_Averages tidy data set accomplish the 5 milestone:

* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each
variable for each activity and each subject.

This data frame size is 180x583, with the features:

The function used was aggregate advanced function in order to group
the data respect to each activity and subject

### Dumping UCI_HAR_Averages ###

The last step was dump the UCI_HAR_Averages dataframe to the
UCI_HAR_Averages.R file.
